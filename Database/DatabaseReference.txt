Our database system is MySQL. MySQL server, client, and python connector (a module of MySQL itself) is installed and
runs locally. Our project uses python to interface with MySQL and the python package: mysql-connector-python which is an
official python package from MySQL. We then have a python function that opens a database connection, and functions in
that file that query the database. These functions can be called from anywhere in the program to get or update data from
the database.
