Our database system is MySQL. MySQL server, client, and python connector (a module of MySQL itself) is installed and
runs locally. Our project uses python to interface with MySQL alongside the python package: mysql-connector-python which is an
official python package from MySQL. We then have a python function that opens a database connection, and functions in
that file that call the connection function and query the database. These functions can be called from anywhere in the 
program to get or update data from the database.

The following functions will need to be implemented:
getScore - takes username, returns score
updateScore - takes 2 usernames and score
getUser - takes username, returns matching username if exists
authorize - takes username and password, returns true if match false if not
getToken - takes username, returns token of that username
adduser - takes username, password
updateToken - takes username, token
getFriends - takes username, returns all list of friends
addFriend - takes username of user and username of friend

The design presented in previous diagrams has not changed since the announcement of plan B.
